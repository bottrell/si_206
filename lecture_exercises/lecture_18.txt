#SQL:

to insert a specfic line into a dataset use the INSERT command:
	''''INSERT INTO Instructors
		VALUES (NULL, "Lampe", "Cliff", "lampecli", NULL)

-"NULL" Specfies a field without any data, just empty
- you can also specify the specific data that you want to enter
	''''INSERT INTO Instructors (FirstName, LastName, Uniqname)
		VALUES ("Cliff", "Lampe", "lampecli")

- to delete records in a specific row we have to specify the table and criteria
	''''DELETE FROM Instructors
		WHERE LastName="Lampe"

- careful that we don't use which will delete fucking everyting
	''''DELETE FROM Instructors

# Updates

- updating will overwrite what is currently in the cell
	''''UPDATE Instructors
		SET Office = '4380'
		WHERE LastName = 'Newman' and FirstName= 'Mark'
